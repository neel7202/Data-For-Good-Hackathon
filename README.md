# NYC Public School Context

## First Tab (2016 School Explorer) 
This tab lists all public schools in NYC in 2016
### Important Columns
- ### Economic Need Index (Column Q)
    - The Economic Need Index (ENI) estimates the percentage of students facing economic hardship. 
    - The metric is calculated as follows - The student's Economic Need Value is 1.0 if:
        - The student is eligible for public assistance from the NYC Human Resources Administration (HRA);
        - The student lived in temporary housing in the past four years; or
        - The student is in high school, has a home language other than English, and entered the NYC DOE for the first time within the last four years
    - Otherwise, the student’s Economic Need Value is based on the percentage of families (with school-age children) in the student’s census tract whose income is below the poverty level, as estimated by the American Community Survey 5-Year estimate (2016 ACS estimates were used in calculations for 2018-19 ENI). The student’s Economic Need Value equals this percentage divided by 100.

- ### ELA (English) & Math Proficiency (Columns AH and AI)
The state has provided four different levels they rank your child at, on a scale of 1-4, with higher numbers being better. Below is the proficiency rating for each of the four levels.
| Level | Description|
|-------|------------|
| Level 1 | Student Performance at this level means your child is well below the expected grade level. This ranking means your child skill level for the section is insufficient for their current grade level and needs vast improvement |
| Level 2 | At level two, your child is considered partially proficient for their grade level. They are considered on track to meeting New York State Graduation requirements but are deemed insufficient to meet Common Core standards for their grade level |
| Level 3 | At level three, your child is considered on track for both New York State graduation requirements and that of the Common Core standards for their grade level | 
| Level 4 | At level four, your child is excelling and is well above the expected standards for their grade level|
